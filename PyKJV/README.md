## Python TUI

Here is a stand-alone command-line (TUI) interface.
Designed to work as far, and as wide, as where Python3
is available.

To use the menu:

python3 kjv.py

To use a quick lookup:

python3 kjv.py --help

p.s. 

You will want to use `python` rather that `python3` on
som operating systems.

Written in 100% pure Python, please use Python 3.6, 
or greater.
