# The Bible Projects

Pure religion has nothing to do with me controlling you - it has to do with God, controlling me. 

Adam, after all, was permitted to do whatever she did.

By their fruit, shall ye know them?

So I make no apologies for the fact that I - like billions of others - get a great feeling when I read the scriptures. 

Indeed, in order to share the warm-and-fuzzy feelings with any who might be able to experience the same, I have learned many technologies. 

Here is where I share the best of those.

Sharing is caring?
